## "Listiga Räven!"
The application we developed is called "Listiga Räven!".
It is indended as a learning game for children of preschool age.  
The game consists of five minigames and a start menu, each game focuses on a different learning aspect.

## Stakeholder
We developed the game with feedback from an upcoming preschool teacher.
She helped us know what was important and what children that age can/should learn.
The stakeholder consistently gave us good feedback on what to improve and what to change.  

## Start menu
Here we will find different portals that lead to the different minigames. Simply press on one of the portals
and the fox will make it's way over to it and enter. The player can come back to this scene at any time
throughout the game.

## Kläder efter väder

## Mattekluringar
A game about learning math, focusing on addition and subtraction. Here the player gets a problem in the middle
off the scene and needs to click on one of the different answers to be able to proceed.
If the answer was wrong, the player gets to a dead end and has to solve the same problem again.
If the answer was right, the player will go ahead to a new problem. This will be repeated as long as the 
player wants to continue on!

## Matcha ord
Focusing on letting the player learn new words, this game is all about matching a word with the corresponding letter.
This works by either clicking on a word and a letter, letting the game drag a line between them or the player
can drag a line themselves by dragging from one card to the other.
If it was correct, the cards will become green. Otherwise, the cards will become red and the line will be removed.
Try and match all the cards to be able to get new words to learn!

## Music game
Here the player will be able to create their own music! Drag down notes from the instruments at the top onto the
different lines. When notes are placed, press play and listen to the amazing music!
The player can also choose to loop the music if they want to, letting them listen to their music over and over.
