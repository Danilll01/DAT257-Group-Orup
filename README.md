## "Listiga Räven!"
The application we developed is called "Listiga Räven!".
It is indended as a learning game for children in preschool.  
The game consists of five minigames and a start menu, each game focuses on a different learning aspect.

## Stakeholder
We developed the game with feedback from an upcoming preschool teacher.
She helped out know what was important and what children that age can/shoudld learn.
