# Individual reflection LV4 - Erik Juliusson
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to further my understanding of the Unity editor. I learned this week that some 
things that I've done in the scripts can be done easily in the editor directly

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help some group members how to use listeners in editor instead of writing code for it

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week I was scrum-master. Trello worked fine without my interference, but I still tried 
to keep an eye on on our backlog. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Now it's possible to win the memory game and either play again or go back to home menu using a 
popup-menu when the game is finished.
