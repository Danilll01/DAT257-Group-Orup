# Individual reflection LV3 - Erik Juliusson
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about programming games in Unity and APIs. I also want to 
understand and work with SCRUM better.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have gotten some understanding of unity and how different objects work regarding UI 
and coroutines, which I’ve helped others use to implement sounds in our memory game

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am active in meetings and try to focus on what can be done better during reviews and 
retrospectives. Furthermore, I’ve tried to do what I can regarding effort estimation 
during our planning, but since I don’t have that much experience it’s hard to estimate 
the workload. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I’ve continued working with user stories, making our memory game pretty much fully 
functional regarding game logic. Sounds have begun to be implemented and the code for 
playing audioclips is in place.
