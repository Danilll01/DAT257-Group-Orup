what do I want to learn or understand better? 
How to take a software project from start to finish, how to use open data as a source and build upon it. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I am not sure, but perhaps I can contribute with a positive spirit. It is hard to tell since I don't know yet what others can. :O 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 
So far, we have come up with a structure in how we work (social contract), and when. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Although I have been home sick this week, I believe my contribution has been being active in discussions (as everyone else).
