Individual reflection 1 - Elin Hagman

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand the SCRUM model better.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I am not sure what I can help with since I don’t know the other team members. But maybe I can contribute with the help of my experience from previous project courses.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been a part of creating the social contract together with the group.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have not contributed anything individually. I have been a part of the meetings, workshop and attended lectures to learn more about SCRUM.
